Plan:

Make an ergonomic Python framework for developing web frontends, with JavaScript
transpiled from Python (Transcrypt), and by building on top of Vue. Will need to
create Python entities that can be turned into Vue, which copy all of the
features I want.

Other thoughts:

Simple Vue showcases seem to require an entire Vue project, if I am to use the
Single File Components. Vue centers around its Single File Components, which 
require a build step. Usually I'll just be looking at things in or adjacent to
/project_name/src/App.vue
